# Frontend Mentor - Interactive pricing component

![Design preview for the Interactive pricing component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking my coding.

This challenges helps me to improve my coding skills in Javascript and gives me freedom to play with DOM manipulation

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this interactive pricing component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
### Page view and pricing totals

Here are the different page view ranges and the corresponding monthly price totals:

- 10K pageviews / $8 per month
- 50K pageviews / $12 per month
- 100K pageviews / $16 per month
- 500k pageviews / $24 per month
- 1M pageviews / $36 per month

If the visitor switches the toggle to yearly billing, a 25% discount should be applied to all prices.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
